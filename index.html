<!-- // good god, well what the heck are you going to do to make up for it (freeloader(smaller font))
	// make sure their house is so clean and nice and be pleasant and not make my wonderful hosts feel like there is a god damn dark cloud over the house, also give $$
		// okay fair enough, are you friends with all of the people in the house your freeloading at?
			// yes     no
				// yes-- okay sweet you'll probably be okay, but you still better be greatful and give your hosts some sweet ass compliments
				//  no-- give the people you dont know a gift or some shit-- but you seem like a decent enough person
	// clean up after myself but also pick up around the house, but no $$ because i am poor and they know that
		// thats okay they are probably poor too-- clean your shit up and don't get in their way
	// nothing really, wear that dark cloud, be a moody baby
		// you're really not going to do anything?
			// no (I will do something) -- 
				// 
			// yes (I will do nothing)
				// your a lost fucking cause-- check yourself, and thank your god damn lucky stars if anyone ever lets you stay at their place ever again -->
